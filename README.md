# Window 4

Window 4 is a first-person narrative game set in a liminal-space where the player finds themselves endlessly waiting in lineâ€”though. Inspired by titles like Backrooms and Platform 8, the game combines surreal atmosphere with subtle tension. Window 4 blends mundane mechanics like managing bladder urgency with the challenge of maintaining your your place in line or being ejected for breaking unspoken rules. Security guards rouitinely patrol the line ensuring that no one is cutting the line and keeping the peace while everyone waits.

Built in Unity 6.x for Windows and macOS, Window 4 explores themes of compliance, monotony, and quiet desperation in a dreamlike space that feels both familiar and disquieting.
