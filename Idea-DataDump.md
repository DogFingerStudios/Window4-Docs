## Idea Data Dump

This document is a collection of ideas and notes for a game concept. 



## NPC Passerbys
* Occasionally people are seen walking in the opposite direction of the line - some are happy, some are crying. 

## Ending Possibilities

* Person at counter tells Player they're missing some paperwork and come back later
* The game literally never ends
* The player hands some paperwork to the person at the counter they stamp it really quick and then say "Next!" 
* The person behind the counter stamps the Player's paperwork and informs them that now they can go wait in another line, when the player arrives the next line it is even longer.
